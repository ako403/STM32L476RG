For Keil uVision this can also be done automatically.

1) Go to Projects->Options for target 'project_name'...

2) Go to the User tab,

3) In Run User Programs After Build/Rebuild...

4) add 'C:\Keil\ARM\ARMCC\bin\fromelf.exe --bin obj\.axf --output .bin' to one of the lines.

This will run the conversion from AXF to BIN automatically after each build.
